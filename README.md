# Todo List Manager
 This application was developed to better handle the paradox of chocies. 
 Especially since there are some many ideas to try and sometimes one may get lost trying out different thigns.
 Having an AI assisant, you can get advices on deciding priorities for your to-do list and reflections for completed tasks.
I used Streamlit for front end and OpenAI's API as backend.


## Features:
1. Random funny greeting
2. Invalid Task Description handling
3. AI recommendations for your priorities
4. Review with AI for inspirations (To be implemented)

## Notice:
  Most tasks take days to complete and with streamlit alone, information is lost if you reopen the application.
  So try connect with an external database.
